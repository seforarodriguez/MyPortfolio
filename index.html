                    <p>
                        Welcome to my corner of the internet. My journey has been quite an adventure, taking me from studying Accounting in the Dominican Republic to diving headfirst into the world of Software Development through the Nashville Software School bootcamp in the United States. 
                        Looking back, it's clear that this transition was the best decision I ever made.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        One of the most remarkable aspects of this journey has been the incredibly supportive and welcoming community that I've encountered along the way. The camaraderie and willingness to help within the Software Development world have made the challenges all the more conquerable. Just as I love solving puzzles, coding presents me with an array of exciting challenges to tackle. The thrill of seeing a complex piece of code finally come together and function seamlessly is an experience I cherish and hope to hold onto. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        While I could wax poetic about my passion for problem-solving, let me instead share a few fun tidbits about myself that might bring a smile to your face. Beyond the world of coding, I have a passion for running – having completed three half-marathons so far. Not only does it keep me physically active, but it also teaches me the value of perseverance. Oh, and did I mention? I'm fluent in Spanish, which adds an exciting dimension to my interactions.   
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Exploration is at the core of my being. Whether it's discovering new places or meeting new people, I find genuine joy in these experiences. This also translates to my love for experimenting with diverse cuisines – there's something magical about the way food connects us with cultures around the world. I hope you enjoy navigating through the rest of my website. It's a reflection of my journey, my passions, and the things that make me who I am. Thank you for visiting!

                        <p>
                            I've designed a handy app for Airbnb managers to simplify cleaning coordination. This tool helps managers work with cleaners to decide the cost and schedule for cleaning houses based on their size and number of bathrooms. Cleaners also get to decide which houses they want to clean, giving them more freedom.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Using this app is easy for managers. It allows the cleaners to give fair cleaning prices considering house details, and it lets managers and cleaners agree on cleaning times. Cleaners benefit by picking houses they're comfortable cleaning. This app makes managing Airbnb properties a breeze for everyone involved.

                        <p>
                            This app lets runners create and oversee their own races in parks. The standout feature is the ability to pick races based on how hard they are. This helps runners choose races that match their skill level, making the whole event even better.
                            Built using ReactJS, Python, and Django, this easy-to-use app lets you set up and manage races effortlessly. Besides managing races, the app also shows different parks and how tough their races are, so you can pick the best fit. Plus, signing up for races in parks is a breeze with the app, making things smooth and easy.
